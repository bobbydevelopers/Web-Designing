                <p>Tesla has surpassed Ford for the first time in the number of wins at the Automotive Loyalty Awards.
                    In total, the brand managed to win in five out of eight nominations.</p>

                <p>The Americans have determined the winners of the Automotive Loyalty Awards 2022. The Tesla brand
                    received the most awards. This was reported on the Autoevolution website.
                </p>

                <p>Tesla often finds itself at the center of various scandals. Often they are associated with poor build
                    quality of electric vehicles or various frauds. Nevertheless, the brand managed to win a huge share
                    of satisfied customers.
                </p>

                <p>Tesla has won five of the eight Manufacturer and Make Loyalty Awards. This year, for the first time,
                    the brand surpassed Ford in terms of customer loyalty in the US. At this time, General Motors leads
                    the category "general loyalty to the automaker."
                </p>

                <p>Experts noted that in 2022, due to the shortage of cars, many customers chose models from other
                    manufacturers. Therefore, the average loyalty to certain brands decreased from 54.6% in 2019 to
                    50.2%

                <p>Tesla received the "General Loyalty to Manufacturing" award for the first time. Prior to that, Ford

                </p>

                <p>
                    Tesla also won in the "Highest Market Conquest Percentage", "Best Alternative Vehicle Loyalty" and
                    "Enhanced Loyalty" nominations. The Model 3 won the Best Premium Compact Car category and the Model
